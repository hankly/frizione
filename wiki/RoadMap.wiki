= The Frizione Road Map =

Frizione is still in its infancy. Until it reaches the ultimate open source project stability goal (that is to say version 1.0), it will probably duck and weave around numerous problems, possibly finding solutions, and most likely making breaking changes with respect to previous versions.

Currently I'm working on reaching version 0.5, which should have better integration with Rhino based tools, and add other JavaScript based tools. I'll also be spending a little time on extending the Clutch library, which is pretty anemic at the moment.

Some of these changes will unfortunately break code based on the previous (0.4, 0.3, 0.2 or 0.1.1) versions. I don't like breaking code, because I probably have more code reliant on Frizione than anyone, so I'm also upsetting myself. I can unfortunately envisage that further breakages are very likely as Clutch gradually takes form. 

The next step is to start developing the Gears project that I had to put on a back burner to develop Frizione. As the Gears project evolves, I will make 'battle hardening' modifications to Frizione.

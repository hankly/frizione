The documentation for Frizione 0.4, including installation instructions
can be found in Frizione/apps/frizione/StaticFiles/docs/Clutch.pdf
This is probably a silly place to put documentation (though it works inside
the web application), so I'll try to move it to a more prominant place in
the next release.
